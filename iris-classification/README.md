I created an iris classification model as my first project. I first standardized the data and changed the names from digits into alphabetic labels, 
and then I split the data into a testing set and a learning set. Following this, I used the DecisionTreeClassifier to train my model as it was a relatively 
small data set of 150. I then tested the predictions of the model and got 100% accuracy
